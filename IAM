Role types
There are three types of roles in Cloud IAM:

Primitive roles, which include the Owner, Editor, and Viewer roles that existed prior to the introduction of Cloud IAM
Predefined roles, which provide granular access for a specific service and are managed by GCP
Custom roles, which provide granular access according to a user-specified list of permissions
