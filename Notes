How resources organized? (organization, project, resources)
What is roles? (collection of permission)
what is policy (collection of roles)
Type of roles ? (Premitive, Predefined, custom roles)
way to handle GC resources? (SDK,Console,API)
SDK GC resources (gcloud - > common tasks, gsutil --> storage, bq --> bug query)
cloud shell to manage resources without installing SDK
RestFul API - Programatically access GCP resources, uses JSON, Oauth2
cloud shell - Persistant 5 GB storage, limit to 1 hour idle time session will be lost
usage gcloud <double tab> gives Group commands
experiement API commands through https://developers.google.com/apis-explorer
GC compute  -  Compute engine (Iaas, suitable server migration, ), Container Engine (de coupled aaplication components, 
App Engine, Kubernetes, amanage application), GC Application(Paas, Managed service, scalability) ,
GC functions (event driven, trigger)
Comparision compute options
 - Cloud function -- Events, Function definitions . --> event driven
 - App Engine - Code, Http Requests . | support Programing lang, Container . --> web facing code
 - Container engine -  Applications , What programs, how connected? state | hybrid, needs metwork protocols --> containerized application
 - Compute Engine - Load balancee, OS , Disk Image, | licensing req --> Existing system
Iaas -Virtual version of physical server
Instance Basics
  - should be lowercase
  - Charged always for storgae
  -GPU option is not available in Cental zone
  - Compute engine default service account  to VM with defauly access
  - equivelant linl provides RestFul API and command line
